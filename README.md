# Smart-Greenhouse-Irrigation-System-with-ATmega164P
Designed and developed an embedded system around the ATmega164P microcontroller, interfacing environmental sensors for automated irrigation control. Implemented a Finite State Machine (FSM) to manage real-time pump operation and provide LED-based status feedback.
